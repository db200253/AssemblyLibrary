# AssemblyLibrary
Maybe my first very long project that I would update often 👀 <br>
It's just an assembly library with usuals functions of the libc and their testing programs but
I think it's really important for a developer to understand low-level concepts 😁 <br>
For now I just implement simple functions but I hope that I would write more complex like malloc or others !!
